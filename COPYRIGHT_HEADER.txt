## Why Add Copyright Headers?

1. **Strengthens Copyright Protection** - Establishes authorship in each file
2. **GPL Compliance** - Recommended best practice for GPL-licensed software
3. **Attribution** - Makes it clear who owns the code
4. **Legal Clarity** - Reminds users of GPL terms and educational purpose

## When to Add

- All Python source files in Python/ directory
- Build scripts (if distributing as part of releases)
- Any substantial code contributions

## When NOT to Add

- Configuration files (JSON, TOML, INI)
- Documentation (MD files already reference LICENSE)
- Small utility scripts (<50 lines)
- Third-party code (respect original licenses)
